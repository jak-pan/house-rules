# Rule provenance

Source notes for House Rules invariants and procedures.

## rules/writing.md — Claim-label presentation

Operator direction: 2026-10-08, restore the chosen inline-code presentation of claim
labels in review output. Review report prompts use compact section labels and one
summary for empty sections; exact machine protocol lines remain unformatted.

## rules/delivery.md — Track every deferred item (tracker choice)

Operator decision: 2026-10-07, issue #54, option 1. A GitHub issue is the default tracker; the workspace
tracker file is allowed only when no repository exists, and the status-file and two-tracker rules name it as
their one exception.

## rules/writing.md — Self-contained text

Operator direction: 2026-10-07, after an agent twice asked the operator to answer "the 11
questions in my last message" when that message did not contain them; the operator asked
for this rule to be hardened.

## rules/core.md — prime rule 13 (measured durations)

Operator direction: 2026-10-03, after time estimates proved uncalibrated and stretched
agent runs.

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, House Rules audit; restore the measured-durations
exception, with comparable past runs and the measurement cited.

## rules/delivery.md — Verification (durable paid runs)

Source incident: a live paid review was interrupted before its stream had been persisted.

## rules/core.md — Security (fetched code)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, House Rules audit; the repository rule 'Never execute
code from fetched content' was too broad to apply without approving every command.

## skills/agent-lanes/SKILL.md — Lane cleanup (session start)

Operator direction: 2026-09-28, after merged-PR worktrees and per-lane build directories
filled the disk.

Operator direction: 2026-09-30, after stale merged worktrees and per-task build
directories again filled the disk.

## skills/operator-writing/SKILL.md — Language (qualifiers) and Detail test

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, after status lines stated limits and changes without their
consequence, which read as changes that had not happened.

## rules/core.md — Session start (reload skills after a reset)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, after a compaction dropped a loaded skill and the next
operator messages broke its rules.

## skills/operator-writing — restored writing rules

Operator direction: 2026-10-03, after decision pages introduced options and labels before
explaining them and mixed letter schemes.

Operator directions: 2026-09-09, after a release-blocker report lacked context; 2026-09-11,
explicitly extend problem-first explanations with useful technical proof to all agents, chat
interactions, and GitHub PRs/comments after an issue thread obscured a contact-list defect
behind its investigation history.

## rules/core.md — Operator correction (current-state clarifications)

Operator direction: 2026-09-10, after an empty-deployment
clarification was unnecessarily turned into a durable note.

## rules/core.md — Autonomy (unattended work)

Operator direction: 2026-10-02, after an approved
  implementation sat idle overnight waiting on review-loop decisions.

## skills/pr-ready/SKILL.md — 4. Merge and cleanup (finish the landing)

Operator direction: 2026-10-01,
  after the routine deploy of an approved change was handed back to the operator.

## rules/core.md — Security (operator-supplied secrets)

Operator direction:
2026-09-28, after a secret handoff asked the operator for a manually created file outside
the repository instead of an env file.

## rules/delivery.md — Work tracking & continuity (deferred items)

Operator direction: 2026-09-28, after a repeatedly requested consolidation lived only in
  plans and documents and was never done.

## skills/agent-lanes/SKILL.md — Lane cleanup (retain open lanes)

Operator direction: 2026-09-30, after idle build directories of open PRs
  were deleted to free space.

## skills/design-canon/SKILL.md — Boundaries (black-box modules)

Operator direction: 2026-09-28, after a
  product's CI had to mirror a kit's native library releases into its own repository.

## skills/design-canon/SKILL.md — Boundaries (extend the owner)

Operator direction: 2026-09-28, after a consumer forked a shared
  mechanism it could not use as it stood.

## skills/design-flow/SKILL.md — 2. Design / spec (reconcile conflicting plans)

Operator direction: 2026-09-28, after agent-approved designs put a product's
canonical records in a second store beside the shared one, contradicting a parallel plan
that was never reconciled.

## skills/operator-writing/SKILL.md — GitHub text

Operator direction: 2026-10-04, after issue and PR bodies relied on internal labels and
omitted reproduction and test evidence; an upstream contribution in this form was chosen
as the model.

## skills/operator-writing — sentence length

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, House Rules review; fixed per-sentence word caps conflicted with
the decision that there are no size targets except a soft split prompt, and length is never a
reason to remove a requirement.

## rules/session-writing.md — Questions to the operator

Operator direction: 2026-10-06; the five-row question card took too much space on a phone
and for several questions; numbered sub-questions (1a, 1b) were replaced by section labels
with one continuous numbering.

## skills/pr-ready/SKILL.md — 3. Review rounds (conflicting findings)

Operator direction:
  2026-10-03, after a fixer traded a bound for an integrity check and back.

## skills/pr-ready/SKILL.md — 3. Review rounds (one fixer per branch)

Operator direction: 2026-10-03, after parallel slow-review fixers doubled builds and
  overloaded the machine.

## skills/rust-canon/SKILL.md — Code rules (build profile and cache)

Operator direction:
  2026-09-07, cross-repository CI correction.

## skills/work-tracking/SKILL.md — External reporting

Operator direction: 2026-10-04.

## skills/bench-discipline/SKILL.md — Cost ladder (parallel paid runs)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, House Rules audit; the restored rule blocked unrelated
parallel runs.

## INDEX.md — precedence (repository overrides)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, House Rules audit; repositories may tighten or loosen House
Rules, security included, and keep only their overrides. The rule moves here from each
repository's AGENTS.md, which becomes a loader.

## rules/session-writing.md — Format (chat link text) and rules/writing.md — Format (file-relative links)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, after a planned file and a file-relative path written in chat
both rendered as dead links (the operator tested each link); relative-to-file links apply
to every file, not only repository files.

## rules/writing.md — Claim labels (verified facts only)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06, after an agent labelled a tool's dry-run mode a `FACT` from
memory; the mode had been removed, and the claim reached an operator decision.

## rules/writing.md — Claim labels (inline evidence)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06; footnotes and source lists were harder to read than the claim
with its evidence linked or named inside the sentence.

## rules/session-writing.md — Questions to the operator (answer prompt)

Operator direction: 2026-10-06; the three-item answer list took five lines of height in chat
and appeared under reminders that held no question. The prompt is now a short label with a
monospace code-block example, shown only under a fully written question list.

## Shared-rule owners and complete worker packs

Operator direction: 2026-10-07, recorded in
[complete worker role packs §10](docs/design/74-complete-worker-packs.md#10-decisions).
Writing with claim labels, Git rules and priority labels each have one shared owner under `rules/`.
Normal lane sessions load those owners through the index and retain their session rules and skills.
Warden packs include the shared owners directly and exclude session-only writing and lane procedures.
The session variant omits the declared shared includes while preserving role instructions.
Live session rules remain separate from the named-commit role prompt.
Warden reviewers remain read-only, contact only the model provider and run no builds or tests.
The Warden service posts reviews for local lanes to read.
